### About it
It's a "Rock, paper, scissors" online game. Made using `HTML`, `css` and `typescript` for the `Frontend`. `Typscript` and `Node.js` for the `Backend`.
For this project i implemented a `Realtime database` to connect both players in the same room.

Using `Firebase` to use the `RTDB` and the `DB`. Also, i used `Postman` to test each endpoint of the `backend` and made a documentation for it's respective use.
